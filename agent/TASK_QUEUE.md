# Task Queue: Autonomous Improvement

## Prioritized Backlog

### Tier 1: Resilience & Automation
1. [ ] **Unit Test Expansion:** Create automated tests for the new `Profiler` and `ResourceMonitor` classes in `tests/test_system_utils.py`.
2. [ ] **Error UI Refinement:** Enhance the `ErrorDisplay` component to include a "Copy Log" button for easier troubleshooting.

### Tier 2: Intelligence & Features
1. [ ] **Scene Search AI Upgrade:** Enhance the prompt suggestion logic with better cinematic components and action extraction.
2. [ ] **Sub-Tab Autosave:** Ensure that the active system sub-tab (Inventory, Phonemes, etc.) is preserved across page refreshes.
