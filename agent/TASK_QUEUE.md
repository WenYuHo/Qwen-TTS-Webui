# Task Queue: Autonomous Improvement

## Prioritized Backlog

### Tier 1: Governance & Safety
1. [ ] **Audit Log:** Create a system-wide audit log for all generation tasks (TTS, Video, Dubbing) stored in `projects/audit.json`.
2. [ ] **UI Polish:** Implement "Technoid Brutalist" style improvements to the new System and Production cards.

### Tier 2: Resource Monitoring
1. [ ] **Resource Monitoring:** Add a "CPU/GPU Load" indicator to the System view.
2. [ ] **Auto-Cleanup:** Implement a background thread to prune stale `uploads/` and `projects/generated_videos/` older than 7 days.

## Awaiting Human Feedback
- Should we move `setup_env.sh` and `start.sh` into a `bin/` or `scripts/` folder? (Standard practice vs ease of use).
