# Product Definition: Qwen-TTS Podcast Studio (v2.1) 🎙️

## Executive Summary
A professional, standalone web suite designed for high-fidelity audio production using Qwen-TTS. It empowers storytellers and voice artists to transform scripts into immersive audio experiences with custom voice cloning and atmospheric background music integration.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Voice-over artists and storytellers seeking to scale their production without sacrificing vocal quality.
- **Secondary:** Independent content creators and podcasters requiring multi-character dialogue capabilities.

## Core Goals
- **High-Fidelity Voice Cloning:** Enable users to create realistic, consistent voice models from minimal audio samples (3s+).
- **Efficient Batch Production:** Streamline the synthesis of long-form, multi-speaker scripts into cohesive audio projects.
- **Atmospheric Storytelling:** Provide tools for layering dialogue with dynamic background music to set specific narrative moods.

## Design Philosophy: Technoid Brutalist Studio
The Studio follows a **Technoid Brutalist** aesthetic, merging high-performance technical utility with a raw, industrial interface:
- **Visual Identity:** Onyx-black backgrounds (#080808) with high-visibility "Volt" (#ccff00) accents.
- **Form Follows Function:** Sharp, 2px borders and multi-layered shadows create a sense of physical depth and mechanical precision.
- **Zero-Friction UX:** Monospace typography for technical data ensures clarity, while glassmorphic surfaces maintain a modern, professional feel.

## Key Features
- **Voice Studio:** Advanced cloning and description-based voice design for unique character creation.
- **Multimodal Timeline:** A granular, blocks-based interface for managing complex dialogues, BGM mixing, and **LTX-Video narrated segments**.
- **Integrated Video Engine:** One-click generation of AI-narrated videos (Qwen-TTS + LTX-Video) directly from script blocks.
- **Batch Synthesis:** High-performance parallel generation for entire scripts with automated speaker and scene assignment.
- **Studio Diagnostics:** Robust health checks and centralized logging for reliable model monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Unified Model Inventory:** A "one-click" system management interface for downloading and verifying Qwen and LTX model checkpoints.

## Problem Statement
The high cost and complexity of producing multi-character audio dramas or narrated stories manually. This studio lowers the barrier to entry for professional-grade AI audio production while maintaining the nuances of human-like speech.
