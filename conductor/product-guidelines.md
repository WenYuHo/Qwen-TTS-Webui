# Product Guidelines: Qwen-TTS Podcast Studio (v2.1) 🎙️

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** **Classic Studio**. The UI should draw inspiration from high-end physical recording studio gear. Use textures, realistic knobs, sliders, and analog-style VU meters to provide a tactile and professional feel.
- **Color Palette:** Deep charcoals, brushed metals, and warm amber or soft green accents for status indicators, mimicking vintage rack-mounted equipment.

## Prose & Tone
- **Style:** **Professional & Expert**. Use industry-standard terminology (e.g., "Gain," "Prosody," "Multi-track," "Synthesis") to establish authority and clarity for a professional user base.
- **Tone:** Precise, direct, and functional. Avoid conversational filler in UI labels and error messages.

## Brand Messaging & Positioning
- **Core Message:** **Simplicity and Accessibility**. Position the studio as the fastest and most intuitive gateway to professional AI voice production.
- **Value Proposition:** Emphasize how the tool removes technical friction, allowing storytellers to focus on their narrative rather than complex software configurations.

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
- **Focused Interaction:** The interface should guide the user through a linear production flow (Voice Design -> Scripting -> Synthesis -> Mixing). Minimize distractions by highlighting only the controls relevant to the current task.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Incorporate subtle animations and visual cues that respond to user interactions, reinforcing the "physical gear" aesthetic.
